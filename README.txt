I implemented a skybox to create the right atmosphere.
I created a realistic scene, including a mountainous terrain with appropriate texture.
I  have several objects with matching textures.
The tree is made up of two objects, a trunk and a crown of leaves.
The camera is also implemented and fixed on an object.
